This file will be used for us to plan out what user stories to use for the second iteration. Again, we only need to focus on 3 user stories like in the last iteration

Patrick's ideas:
-Bookmark a series into the user's database
-Access the user's archive and mark a series as "Put on Hold", or remove a series from their archive
-Access the bookmarked series and be able to return to the last point of the story reached before holding
-Sort the user's archive according to their preferences
