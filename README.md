# APP NAME: SEAN

October 6th, 2016:
-Added in the MainActivity, NoSuchShowExists, and AddNewSeries java and XML files. 
-First tests to run the app did not compile at first, but the error was easily resolved.
-The files would not compile due to a string error with one of the text boxes (Android Studio mistakenly used a hyphen instead of an underscore to represent a space in the textView string code).

October 9th, 2016:
-Added HomePage, MyArchive, AppSettings, and Profile java and XML files to the repository.
-Updated MainActivity (renamed as SearchPage), NoSuchShowExists, and AddNewSeries java and XML files.
-Updated strings.xml file to reflect new uploads and updated code strings.
-Shifted Main Activity Launcher from SearchPage to HomePage.
