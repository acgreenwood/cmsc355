On October 6th, the MainActivity, NoSuchShowExists, and AddNewSeries java and XML files were uploaded into the github repository. Difficulties uploading the files were encountered early on but quickly resolved after fixing up the string files in one of the xml files. One day later a WIP of the app's database (in the form of a temporary ArrayList) was uploaded, with work being done to it in the following days after the upload. 

October 9th, 2016: HomePage, MyArchive, AppSettings, and Profile java and XML files were added to the repository. Code changes to the existing files on the respository were made to accomodate the new files that were uploaded:
-Updated MainActivity (renamed as SearchPage), NoSuchShowExists, and AddNewSeries java and XML files.
-Updated strings.xml file to reflect new uploads and updated code strings.
-Shifted Main Activity Launcher from SearchPage to HomePage.
